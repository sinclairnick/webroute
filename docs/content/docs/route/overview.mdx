Webroute makes building fully-fledged standalone HTTP routes easy. The end result can be run anywhere web standard `Request` and `Response` are supported, including without any router.

Conceptually, `route` moves middleware and I/O validation out of the router and into the route itself. This enables powerful composition and each route becomes incredibly portable.

The utility of this approach becomes clear when used with `nextjs` or other filesystem routers, for example:

```ts twoslash
// ---cut-start---
import { route } from "@webroute/route"
import { z } from "zod"
// ---cut-end---
export const GET = route()

	// Specify middleware, returning data will update the `state` field later
	.use((req, { state }) => {
		return { ...state, userId: "123" }
	})

	// Specify any input and output validators...
	.body(z.object({ name: z.string() }))

	// Handle the request...
	.handle(async (req, { state, parse }) => {
		const { userId } = state
		const { name } = await parse("body") // Lazily validate body

		return { ok: true } // Sends as JSON
		// or: return Response.json(...)
	})

// Just a regular request handler
const response = await GET(new Request("https://google.com"))
```

And you could use this exact same route handler with Hono too.

```ts
app.get("/post", c => GET(c.req.raw))
```

By packaging the validation and middleware (and more) with the route itself, it becomes incredible portable, and you'll find your applications actually become _simpler_ too.
