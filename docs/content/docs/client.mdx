```ts twoslash
import { DefineApp, createTypedClient, FromWebroutes, createUrl } from "@webroute/client"
```

The `@webroute/client` package provides a headless, extremely flexible client interface which provides end-to-end typesafety.

**It need not be used in conjunction with `@webroute/core`.**

It can be used with the fetching library of your choice and is designed to expedite client-side development as well as reducing errors and mistakes, by better enforcing your API contract.

---

## Define App

We can arbitrarily define our API schema for a typed client via the `DefineApp` type.

```ts
import { DefineApp } from "@webroute/client"

type App = DefineApp<{
	"GET /posts": {
		Query: { limit?: number }
	}
}>;
```

Or, if you're using `webroute`s on the backend, you can convert this into the appropriate shape via the `FromWebroute` helper.

```ts
// Define routes in object
const appRoutes = {
	PostRoute,

	// Note: Object keys are irrelevant
	foo: UserRoute,
	bar: CommentRoute,
}
// E.g. export this from your backend in a monorepo, or package via NPM
type AppRoutes = typeof appRoutes

type App = FromWebroutes.InferApp<AppRoutes>;
```

<Callout title="Why use objects if the keys don't matter?">
App routes are defined in an object instead of an array to improve TypeScript inference performance.
</Callout>


## Typed Client

The typed client is an extremely lightweight, so-called "headless" client-side interface for your API. It is entirely unopinionated about how fetching is done and merely wires up end-to-end type safety, without getting in your way.


```ts title="react-app/api-client.ts"
// Create a lightweight client instance
const client = createTypedClient<App>({
	fetcher: myFetcher
})

// Each API operation is represented as a single, flat key
// in the form `{METHOD} {path}`
const getPost = client("GET /post/:id")

getPost({ id: 123 }, fetcherOptions)
```

Our custom fetcher is responsible for executing our request and parsing our response, if need be. It allows for flexible options and return types.

```ts
import { createUrl } from "@webroute/client"

const myFetcher = async (
		// Contains info about path, method, body etc.
		config,

		// Any additional parameters are exposed via the client instance
		// and fully typed.
		opts: AxiosRequestConfig
	) => {
		const { path, method, body, params, query } = config

	// ... Fetch using any method...
}
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title='Creating URLs more easily with createUrl()'>


It can be tedious to convert the `path`, `query` and `params` into a corresoponding url. If you require this functionality, you can use the `createUrl` utility. If you need more custom functionality, you can always roll your own.

```ts
// ...myFetcher
	// `createUrl` is a small helper for combining the path pattern with path and query params.
	const url = createUrl(config);

	// e.g. use axios
	const res = await axios({
		url,
		method: config.method,
		data: config.body,
		...opts,
	});

	return res;
// ...myFetcher
```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>


## Schema Types

The `App` definition is a very simple type which we can directly reference to get information on our routes `body`, `output` etc.

```ts
const operation = "GET /posts" satistfies keyof App // an API operation
type Endpoint = App[typeof operation];

type Query = Endpoint["Query"];
type Params = Endpoint["Params"];
type Body = Endpoint["Body"];
type Output = Endpoint["Output"];
```

This is helpful for defining our own fetching functions or wrapping typed-client functionality.

```ts
export const getPost = async (params: Params): Promise<Result> => {
	// ...
}
```
