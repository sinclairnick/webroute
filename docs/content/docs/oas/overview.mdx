```ts
import { OAS, createSpec, ParseSpec } from "@webroute/oas"
```

`@webroute/oas` provides utilities for building and consuming OpenAPI specs.

<Callout>
All `@webroute/oas` functionality leverages the fantastic work by the `openapi3-ts` package.

### Server-side

When creating our APIs, we add metadata to our schema, which is then interpreted by `createSpec`, to enrich our OpenAPI specs without any awkward APIs.

```ts
const DecoratedSchema = OAS.Schema(
	UserSchema,
	{
		id: "User",
		description: "A public user object"
	}
)
```

### Inference

`@webroute/oas` enables directly parsing an OpenAPI spec into useful typescript types, _without any code generation_.

```ts
import spec from "openapi-spec.json"

type AppSpec = ParseSpec<typeof spec>;
```

This is primarily useful for generating typed clients, but can also be used to define backends up-front and implementing the routes thereafter.
