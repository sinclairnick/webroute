```ts
import { createRadixRouter, createLinearRouter } from "@webroute/router"
```

`@webroute/router` exports several routers which simply match handlers to an incoming request.

All router have the shape

```ts
export type RequestRouter<T> = {
  match: (request: Request) => T | undefined;
  matchAll: (request: Request) => T[];
};
```

## Example Usage

```ts
const router = createRouter([
	{ 
		path: "/foo",
		methods: ["GET"],
		payload: () => "1" // Handler can be any function
	},
	{ 
		path: "/bar",
		methods: ["POST"],
		payload: () => "2" // Handler can be any function
	},
])

const handler = router.match(new Request("https://myapi.com/bar", { method: "post" }))
const result = handler?.() // "2"
```

## Routers

In most cases, you will want to use the faster `radix` router which uses the `radix` algorithm to quickly find route handlers.

### Radix Router

```ts
import { createRadixRouter } from "@webroute/router"

const router = createRadixRouter([
		{ 
			path: "/foo",
			methods: ["GET"],
			payload: () => "Some handler" // Handler can be any function
		},
	]);
```

### Linear Router

However, in some instances – like if route registration order is important – you might want to use the linear router.

```ts
import { createLinearRouter } from "@webroute/router"

const router = createLinearRouter([
		{ 
			path: "/foo",
			methods: ["GET"],
			payload: () => "Some handler" // Handler can be any function
		},
	]);
```
